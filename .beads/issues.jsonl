{"id":"langley-5i2.1","title":"State file infrastructure (state.go)","description":"Create `cmd/langley/state.go` with ServerState struct and FileStateStore for reading/writing server state to disk.\n\n## Context\n`langley run` needs to discover the running server's addresses. The server writes state on startup; `langley run` reads it. State file location: `~/.config/langley/state.json` (Unix) or `%APPDATA%\\langley\\state.json` (Windows).\n\n## Implementation\n\n### ServerState struct\n```go\ntype ServerState struct {\n    ProxyAddr string    `json:\"proxy_addr\"`\n    APIAddr   string    `json:\"api_addr\"`\n    CAPath    string    `json:\"ca_path\"`\n    PID       int       `json:\"pid\"`\n    StartedAt time.Time `json:\"started_at\"`\n}\n```\n\n### FileStateStore\nImplements both StateReader and StateWriter interfaces (defined in run.go bead).\n\n### CRITICAL details from review\n\n1. **Use `config.ConfigDir()`** (exported, from `internal/config`), NOT `configDir()` (does not exist in this package). Must import `langley/internal/config`.\n\n2. **Sentinel error**: `Read()` returns `ErrServerNotRunning` (a package-level `var`), NOT a formatted multi-line string. The call site in `Execute()` formats the user-facing message. This prevents double-wrapping: `Error: Langley server is not running...` instead of `Error: Error: Langley server is not running...`.\n\n3. **State validation**: `Read()` must reject state with empty `proxy_addr` or `api_addr`. Otherwise health check connects to `http:///api/health` — confusing error.\n\n4. **Atomic writes (Windows-safe)**: `Write()` must `os.Remove(s.path)` BEFORE `os.Rename(tmpPath, s.path)`. On Windows, `os.Rename` fails if destination exists. Without this, every write after the first will fail.\n\n5. **Directory creation**: `Write()` calls `os.MkdirAll(dir, 0700)` before writing.\n\n6. **Delete is idempotent**: `Delete()` returns nil if file already gone.\n\n## Files\n- `cmd/langley/state.go` (NEW, ~80 lines)","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] ServerState struct with json tags: proxy_addr, api_addr, ca_path, pid, started_at\n- [ ] FileStateStore uses config.ConfigDir() (NOT configDir) with proper import\n- [ ] ErrServerNotRunning sentinel error (var, not formatted string)\n- [ ] Read() returns ErrServerNotRunning when file missing (os.IsNotExist)\n- [ ] Read() returns error for malformed JSON\n- [ ] Read() validates proxy_addr and api_addr are non-empty\n- [ ] Write() creates parent directory with 0700 permissions\n- [ ] Write() uses atomic temp-file + rename pattern\n- [ ] Write() calls os.Remove before os.Rename (Windows compatibility)\n- [ ] Delete() returns nil if file already gone (idempotent)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-29T09:53:04.141694400Z","updated_at":"2026-01-31T06:44:49.045427200Z","closed_at":"2026-01-31T06:44:49.045427200Z","close_reason":"Closed","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"labels":["feature","run-command"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"langley-5i2.1","depends_on_id":"langley-5i2","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-29T09:53:04.142881200Z","created_by":"unknown","metadata":"","thread_id":""}]}

No args → print usage, return 1\n2. Read state → on ErrServerNotRunning, print friendly multi-line message at THIS layer (not from Read)\n3. Health check → GET `http://{api_addr}/api/health` with 2s context timeout\n4. Verify CA exists → clear error with path\n5. Build env → spawn subprocess\n\n## CRITICAL details from review\n\n1. **Health endpoint is `/api/health`** (existing, unauthenticated at `internal/api/api.go:103`). Do NOT create a new `/health` endpoint. The plan originally had the wrong path.\n\n2. **Sentinel error handling**: `Execute()` checks `errors.Is(err, ErrServerNotRunning)` and prints the friendly message itself. Other errors print `Error: <err>`. This prevents the double-wrap bug.\n\n3. **Case-insensitive env dedup**: `ProxyEnvBuilder.Build()` must use `strings.ToUpper()` for the filter map. On Windows, `os.Environ()` preserves original casing (e.g., `Https_Proxy`) but env vars are case-insensitive. A case-sensitive map lookup would miss these, leaving duplicate keys.\n\n4. **Override list**: HTTPS_PROXY, https_proxy, HTTP_PROXY, http_proxy, NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS, SSL_CERT_FILE, REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE. Both upper and lowercase proxy vars for curl/wget/Python compatibility.\n\n5. **NO_PROXY preserved**: The filter only removes keys in the override map.

State file write — TIMING IS CRITICAL\nWrite state AFTER the `apiSrv.Serve(apiListener)` goroutine is launched (around line 255), NOT after listener bind (line 153).\n\n**Why**: Listeners bind at line 153 (`listenWithFallback`) but `Serve()` starts later. If state is written after bind but before Serve, `langley run` reads state, health-checks `/api/health`, and gets connection refused because nobody is calling `Accept()` yet.\n\nWriting after the Serve goroutine launches is safe: the goroutine will be scheduled and accepting connections before any external process can read the file, resolve DNS, and connect.\n\n```go\nstateStore, err := NewFileStateStore()\nif err != nil {\n    slog.Warn(\"failed to create state store\", \"error\", err)\n} else {\n    if err := stateStore.Write(ServerState{\n        ProxyAddr: actualProxyAddr,\n        APIAddr:   actualAPIAddr,\n        CAPath:    caPath,\n        PID:       os.Getpid(),\n        StartedAt: time.Now(),\n    }); err != nil {\n        slog.Warn(\"failed to write state file\", \"error\", err)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 3.
